Smart Fridge: Food Directory System (by JiakPeng)
Problems we discovered on the normal fridge:
1. People forget about the expiry date of the food, leading to wastage of food
2. People buy certain stuff repeatly since they forget that they still have it in the fridge
Our solution
1. A database to store the food and its pic & expiry date
2. There is two ways to input and access the data, which is through voice command and web app
3. by voice command, the user can know about the expiry date of the food anytime at home
4. web app is an alternative for the user to check the database, it also visualize how close is a certain food to its expiry date
